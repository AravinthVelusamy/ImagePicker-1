<br>

### Usage

ImagePicker view can be loaded directly as a DialogFragment.

<br>

#### MainActivity.java

```
// instantiate the TimelineFragment
ImagePickerFragment imagePickerFragment = new ImagePickerFragment();

FragmentTransaction ft = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();

//add on click lictener
imagePickerFragment.addOnClickListener(new ImagePickerListener() {
                @Override
                public void onPhotoClicked(PhotoObject photoObject) {
                    
                }

                @Override
                public void onCameraClicked(Bitmap image) {

                }
            });

imagePickerFragment.show(ft, "dialog");

```
<br>

#### Use different image loading library

For Image loading this library uses Picasso, But you can use any library you preffer to load the image.
For this, create a class ```ImageLoad``` which  ```implements ImageLoadingEngine``` 
```
public class ImageLoad implements ImageLoadingEngine {
    @Override
    public void onLoadImage(ImageView imageView, String uri) {
          // Use any library you prefer to load the image into the view
    }
}
```
And before showing the DialogFragment, add following line of code.<br>
```imagePickerFragment.setImageLoadEngine(new ImageLoad());```

<br>

#### PhotoObject

| Functions | Details |
|---|---|
|```String getName()``` | Name the the file |
|```String getPath()``` | Path of the file |
|```String getCreated_timestamp()``` | Timestamp of the date created of the file |
|```String getPicasa_id()```| Picasa id associated with photo. ```null``` if no picasa id is found|
|```double getLat()``` | Latitude of the photo |
|```double getLng()``` | Longitude of the photo |

<br>

#### Configuration

| Function | Usage |
|---|---|
|```addOnClickListener();```| Implement click events on the photos or camera <br>1. ```void onPhotoClicked(PhotoObject photoObject) {...}``` <br>2. ```void onCameraClicked(Bitmap image) {...}```|
|```disableDefaultCameraFunction(boolean status)```| Will not open the camera and on clicking the camera option will return null bitmap, So that you can implement any thing you want.|
|```disableDefaultCameraButton(boolean status)```| Will hide the camera button and only show Gallery images.|
|```void setImageLoadEngine(ImageLoadEngine engine)```| Set the custom login to load image into the recycler view. By default ImagePicker uses Glide 4.x, and has optimized memory management.|
|```void saveImageToGallery(Bitmap bitmap, String name)```| Will save the bitmap to default gallery. ```name``` will be the name of the file with extension.<br>Ex: ```new_img.jpg```|
